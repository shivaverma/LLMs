      "\n",
      "Subtopic 2: How does gravity affect objects on earth?\n",
      "Gravity affects everything on earth by keeping objects grounded and pulling them towards the center of the earth. This is why we don't float away into space! We feel the effects of gravity as our weight, which can vary depending on our location and altitude. Gravity also causes things to fall back to the ground when they are lifted up and released.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtopic 3: What is the difference between weight and mass?\n",
      "Weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object, while mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. Weight is a result of the gravitational force pulling an object towards the earth, while mass is an inherent property of the object itself. Weight can vary depending on the location of the object, while mass is constant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtopic 4: How does gravity vary across the surface of the earth?\n",
      "Gravity does not vary much across the surface of the earth, but it does vary slightly depending on your location and altitude. For example, if you are at a higher altitude, you will experience slightly less gravity than if you are at sea level. This is because the further you are from the center of the earth, the weaker the gravitational force. Additionally, gravity is slighter stronger closer to the poles and weaker near the equator, due to the shape and rotation of the earth.\n"
